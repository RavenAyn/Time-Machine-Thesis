# Time-Machine-Thesis
Code for honours thesis regarding how to build a time machine. The python code is extraordinarily slow due to the number of calculations that need to be performed, the wolfram runs faster due to no symbol interpretation needed.


For the python, sample inputs are given at the bottom of the code. Input metrics in a differential form, i.e. for a basic metric like
s**2 = x**2 + y**2 + z**2

enter as 

ds**2 = dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2


For the wolfram enter the metric manually under "ds = ..."
